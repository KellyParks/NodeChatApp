# Chat Application with Node, MongoDB, Express and Socket.IO

Note: This is incomplete and still a work in progress

I wanted to try creating a project that was a little more complex than a CRUD app, so this is an endevour to build a real-time chat application using Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Socket.io. Most of the tutorials I've found for this are incomplete or don't explain things very well, so I thought this would be a good exercise in breaking down a problem as well as furthing learning with Node.js.
